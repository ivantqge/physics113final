## Motivation

This project explores the practical advantages of quantum algorithms over classical counterparts in the fields of factorization and search. Quantum computing has shown promise in solving specific types of problems more efficiently than classical computing. By investigating Shor's algorithm for factorization and Grover's algorithm for search, we aim to understand the computational benefits and potential applications of quantum algorithms.

## Project Overview

### Factorization (Shor's Algorithm)

Shor's algorithm is a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, which has profound implications for cryptography. Classical algorithms for factoring large integers are inefficient and time-consuming, making them infeasible for very large numbers. Shor's algorithm, on the other hand, can factorize integers in polynomial time, posing a significant threat to classical encryption methods that rely on the difficulty of factorization, such as RSA.

## Unsorted Search (Grover’s algorithm) 

Grover’s algorithm is a quantum algorithm typically known for its capabilities to perform an unstructured search. Classical algorithms can do a search over a domain size of N in O(N), while Grover’s algorithm can do this in the time of O(sqrt(N)). Algorithms that contain exhaustive searches can benefit from Grover’s algorithm, which uses amplitude amplification, to achieve better performance in shorter times. While Grover’s algorithm is typically called an “unsorted search” algorithm, it is more well-posed by defining some function f(x), where the function will return 1 when x  is the target state in the domain, and returns 0 if x is not the target state. In this case, Grover’s algorithm uses amplitude amplification to search for x0 such that f(x0)  = 1.

#### Key Notes:

- **3 implementations**: Here we compare a fully classical factorization method, a classical implementation of Shor's factorization method and a semi-quantum implementation of Shor's Factorization method.
- **Comparision Parameters:** We primarily compare the three implementations of factorization on their time for inputs of various sizes.
- **Folder Structure**: As you explore the Shor's implementations, try to remain primarily in the shor.ipynb notebook. This includes the majority of our contribution, and from this runner we've imported some updated/enhanced implementations of *Pavón*'s Quantum Shor.


#### Potential Applications:

Here we considered a contrived example in which a group of physicist engineers attempt to build a multi-dimensional animal stable. As we target some specific square footage (ex. 781 sq ft), we consider how we can maximize the number of dimensions our stable exists in, while minimizing the length of each side of our stable (including dimensional floors). As a result, factorization allows us to find the smallest lengths, increase the dimensions and consider larger and larger square footages.

### Search (Grover's Algorithm)

Grover's algorithm is designed for unstructured search problems, providing a quadratic speedup over classical search algorithms. While classical algorithms need \(O(N)\) time to search an unsorted database of \(N\) entries, Grover's algorithm can find the desired entry in \(O(\sqrt{N})\) time. 

#### Key Notes:
-**Grover’s Implementation**: Code was built on various basic implementations of Grover’s algorithm using Qiskit, primarily using Qiskit’s GroverOperator library to perform iterations of Grover’s algorithm. Various add-ons are included to test code on Qiskit’s QASM simulator, fake backends, as well as on real IBM quantum hardware.
